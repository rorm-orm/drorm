/// # Usage
/// ```no_run
/// # use rorm::{Model, Patch, Database, delete};
/// # #[derive(Model)] pub struct User { #[rorm(id)] id: i64, age: i32, }
/// # #[derive(Patch)] #[rorm(model = "User")] pub struct UserPatch { id: i64, }
/// pub async fn delete_single_user(db: &Database, user: &UserPatch) {
///     delete(db, User)
///         .single(user)
///         .await
///         .unwrap();
/// }
/// pub async fn delete_many_users(db: &Database, users: &[UserPatch]) {
///     delete(db, User)
///         .bulk(users)
///         .await
///         .unwrap();
/// }
/// pub async fn delete_underage(db: &Database) {
///     let num_deleted: u64 = delete(db, User)
///         .condition(User.age.less_equals(18))
///         .await

/// }
///```
///
/// Like every crud macro `delete!` starts a [builder](DeleteBuilder) which is consumed to execute the query.
///
/// `delete!`'s first argument is a reference to the [`Database`](crate::Database).
/// Its second is the [`Model`] type of whose table you want to delete columns from.
///
/// To specify what rows to delete use the following methods,
/// which will consume the builder and execute the query:
/// - [`single`](DeleteBuilder::single): Delete a single row identified by a patch instance
/// - [`bulk`](DeleteBuilder::bulk): Delete a bulk of rows identified by patch instances
/// - [`condition`](DeleteBuilder::condition): Delete all rows matching a condition
/// - [`all`](DeleteBuilder::all): Unconditionally delete all rows
